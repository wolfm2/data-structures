# Overview

This is relatively simple code that consists of a function and a main loop. 

The loop counts from 10 to 1 and hands the int off as an argument to the function.

The function zero-pads single digits and uses the result to form an URL.

The URL is used in a node version of XMLHttpRequest and optionally writes the 
file to the hd on success or emits a failure code.
